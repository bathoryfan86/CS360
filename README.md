Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of my application was to provide a way for the user to keep track of the inventory they had and be able to receive notifications when they go in and out of stock. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I used three different screens for this project to function properly. It needed a way for users to register accounts, a feature to manually add and remove stock, and give permissions to SMS text messages that would send notifications. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approached this applicaiton but determining the needs of the user. I wanted to design the user interface and make it appealing while being functional  and simple. This would help with the main use of the application by tracking inventory properly. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I made sure to test each page to make sure everything was running properly. This helps you outline what is needed and shows what has to be improved. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had a big challenge with this project in general. As someone that has never used Android Studio it was easy to figure out the design elements but being able to test out the application and getting it to function properly was a difficult process. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The user interface and layout design was the fun part of this project. Coding in a new platform is always going to be difficult especially with having a limited amount of time to practice.
